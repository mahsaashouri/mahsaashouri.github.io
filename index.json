We propose a prediction-based detection method for finding highway traffic anomalies using reconciled ordinary least squares (OLS) forecasts and bootstrap prediction intervals. Two fundamental features of traffic flow time series, seasonality, and spatial autocorrelation, are captured by adding Fourier terms in OLS models, spatial aggregation (as a hierarchical structure mimicking the geographical division in regions, cities, and stations), and a reconciliation step. Our approach, although simple, is able to model complex traffic datasets with reasonable accuracy. Being based on OLS, it is efficient and permits avoiding the  computational burden of more complex methods. Analyses of Taiwan's consecutive holidays in 2019, 2020, and 2021 (73 days) showed strong variations in anomalies across different directions and highways. Specifically, we detected some areas and highways comprising a very high number of traffic anomalies (north direction-central region-highways No. 1 and 3, south direction-southern region-highway No.3), and others with generally normal traffic (east and west direction). These results could provide important decision-support information to traffic authorities.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Taiwanese traffic policy on consecutive holidays through forecast reconciliation and prediction-based anomaly detection techniques","type":"publication-in-progress"},{"authors":["Mahsa Ashouri","Frederick Kin Hing Phoa","Chun-houh Chen","Galit Shmueli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673049600,"objectID":"a7f8f27c37e8cee6f5500e48965d1bc6","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/journal-article4/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article4/","section":"publication","summary":"Examining PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter with a maximum diameter of 2.5 micrometers), seasonal patterns is an important research area for environmental scientists. An improved understanding of PM2.5 seasonal patterns can help environmental protection agencies (EPAs) make decisions and develop complex models for controlling the concentration of PM2.5 in different regions. This work proposes an R Shiny App web-based interactive tool, namely a “model-based time series clustering” (MTSC) tool, for clustering PM2.5 time series using spatial and population variables and their temporal features, like seasonality. Our tool allows stakeholders to visualize important characteristics of PM2.5 time series, including temporal patterns and missing values, and cluster series by attribute groupings. We apply the MTSC tool to cluster Taiwan’s PM2.5 time series based on air quality zones and types of monitoring stations. The tool clusters the series into four clusters that reveal several phenomena, including an improvement in Taiwan's air quality since 2017 in all regions, although at varying rates, an increasing pattern of PM2.5 concentration when moving from northern towards southern regions, winter/summer seasonal patterns that are more pronounced in certain types of areas (e.g., industrial), and unusual behavior in the southernmost region. The tool provides cluster-specific quantitative figures, like seasonal variations in PM2.5 concentration in different air quality zones of Taiwan, and identifies, for example, an annual peak in early January and February (maximum value around 120 ). Our analysis identifies a region in southernmost Taiwan as different from other zones that are currently grouped together with it by Taiwan EPA (TEPA), and a northern region that behaves differently from its TEPA grouping. All these cluster-based insights help EPA experts implement short-term zone-specific air quality policies (e.g., fireworks and traffic regulations, school closures) as well as longer-term decision-making (e.g., transport control stations, fuel permits, old vehicle replacement, fuel type).","tags":null,"title":"An interactive clustering-based visualization tool for air quality data analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahsa Ashouri","Frederick Kin Hing Phoa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"114eb2cc5a80e7a63a7ad85ac647049c","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/journal-article3/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article3/","section":"publication","summary":"In this research, we aimed to demonstrate the importance of Management Information systems (MISs) in education planning by collecting data and delivering forecast results to stakeholders. A critical question is whether the data collected by a system is adequate for producing the analytics necessary for decision-making. We describe the case of a new education MIS in Taiwan, where the population of preschool children in different school districts is constantly changing. These changes challenge school resource planning, especially in terms of teacher hiring. The bureaus of education in charge of resource allocation require accurate school-level one-to-five-year-ahead forecasts of the number of incoming first-grade classrooms. Therefore, the Ministry of Education launched a K-9 student data management system (k9sdms) that allows schools to update data on existing and prospective students directly. We evaluate whether using this system supports the goal of generating one-to-five-year-ahead forecasts, thereby assessing the value of the MIS for its intended usage. Using data until 2014, we developed a forecasting model for the number of first-grade classrooms at each school in Taiwan from 2015-2019. The quality of forecasts shows that k9sdms can produce valuable results, thereby achieving its purpose. Because the time series for each school was very short (six years for a number of first-grade students and five years for five-year-old children), we did not fit separate models for each school. Instead, we attempted to capture the change in school-level population sizes by using the information from three consecutive years. We used a linear regression model that can use suitable predictors (input variables) to capture the trend and/or seasonality and other patterns. The model, estimated from the training period, could produce forecasts on future data by inserting the relevant predictor information into the estimated regression equation. We explored different linear regression configurations. The output variable was always the number of first-grade students in year t; the predictors were the number of first-grade students in prior years and the five-year-old population in previous years.","tags":null,"title":"Interactive tool for clustering and forecasting patterns of Taiwan COVID-19 spread","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hohyun Jung","Frederick Kin Hing Phoa","Mahsa Ashouri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"270a8d85655761b7f097352f96382175","permalink":"https://example.com/proceeding/proceeding1/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/proceeding/proceeding1/","section":"Proceeding","summary":"In this paper, we focus on the popularity effect of the scientific collaboration process that popular authors have an advantage in making more publications.

Base forecasts can be computed by popular time series forecasting methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ETS) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The reconciliation step is a linear process that adjusts the base forecasts to ensure they are coherent. However using ETS or ARIMA for base forecasts can be computationally challenging when there are a large number of series to forecast, as each model must be numerically optimized for each series. We propose a linear model that avoids this computational problem and handles the forecasting and reconciliation in a single step. The proposed method is very flexible in incorporating external data, handling missing values and model selection. We illustrate our approach using two datasets; monthly Australian domestic tourism and daily Wikipedia pageviews. We compare our approach to reconciliation using ETS and ARIMA, and show that our approach is much faster while providing similar levels of forecast accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"Fast forecast reconciliation using linear models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahsa Ashouri","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, this flexibility can cause uncertainty and become a challenge if not managed dynamically. An important task for such platforms is forecasting future daily occupancy in a certain area, with sufficient lead time so that they can reach out to new hosts and secure more rooms in time for peak demand. We developed such a forecasting solution for AsiaYo, the largest Chinese language online accommodation sharing platform. We evaluate and compare various forecasting algorithms, including statistical and machine learning methods, using two years of data from AsiaYo on occupancy in different cities. The empirical results show that the occupancy is highly dependent on the weekday, city, and holidays. We show the strengths and weaknesses of different methods in terms of required accuracy level, computation time, and flexibility.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting daily accommodation occupancy for supply preparation by a sharing economy platform","type":"Proceeding"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The methods are based on model-based partitioning (MOB) trees and can be used as an automated yet transparent tool for clustering a large collection of time series. Using a single linear regression model, the single-step method clusters series using trend, seasonality, time series lags, and domain-relevant cross-sectional attributes. The two-step method first clusters by trend, seasonality, and domain-relevant cross-sectional attributes, then further clusters the residuals series by autocorrelation and the domain-relevant cross-sectional attributes. Both methods produce clusters that are interpretable by domain experts. We illustrate the usefulness of the proposed clustering approach by considering one-step-ahead forecasting. We present empirical results comparing our approach to forecasting each series using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model applied to a large set of Wikipedia article pageviews time series. Our results show that the tree-based approach produces forecasts practically on par with ARIMA models yet are significantly faster and more efficient, thereby suitable for scaling to large collections of time series. Moreover, our method produces simple parametric forecasting models for interpretable clusters of time series, whereas ARIMA cannot provide such interpretability.","tags":null,"title":"Tree-based methods for clustering time series using domain-relevant attributes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahsa Ashouri"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

These financial activities have created a huge amount of customer behavioral data, which is regarded as important information for direct marketing. We utilized powerful deep learning algorithms combined with oversampling and feature extraction techniques, applied to behavioral financial data, for direct marketing. This paper describes an implementation of prediction models combined with practical business and analytic goals. Real-world data used in model training and testing were collected from a Portuguese bank marketing campaign. Our model achieved a lift index of 91.76%, which is comparable to the random forest (92.03%) and better than näıve Bayes (80.89%) and logistic regression (89.72%). We find that increasing the amount of training data available improves performance of the deep learning algorithm. Therefore, we believe that our model will potentially outperform the random forest with sufficiently large samples. With this close integration of business analytics and deep learning, our model can be thought of as a prototype for direct marketing and can be finally implemented in FHC systems to deal with large amounts of data.","tags":null,"title":"A deep learning approach to bank direct marketing","type":"Proceeding"},{"authors":["Mahsa Ashouri","Kate Cai","Furen Lin","Galit Shmueli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"d5d20be84aa461b6d2f1df8ef2a1336c","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/journal-article2/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article2/","section":"publication","summary":"Analytics is important for education planning. Deploying forecasting analytics requires management information systems (MISs) that collect the needed data and deliver the forecasts to stakeholders. A critical question is whether the data collected by a system is adequate for producing the analytics for decision making. We describe the case of a new education MIS in Taiwan, where the population of preschool children in different school districts is constantly changing. These changes challenge school resource planning, especially in terms of teacher hiring. The bureaus of education in charge of resource allocation are in need of accurate school-level one-to-five-year-ahead forecasts of the number of incoming first-grade classrooms. The Ministry of Education therefore launched a K–9 student data management system (k9sdms) that allows schools to directly update data on existing and prospective students. We evaluate whether using this system supports the goal of generating one-to-five-year-ahead forecasts, thereby assessing the value of the MIS for its intended usage. Using data until 2014, we developed a forecasting model for the number of first-grade classrooms at each school in Taiwan in 2015–2019. The quality of forecasts shows that k9sdms can produce valuable results, thereby achieving its purpose.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the Value of an Information System for Developing Predictive Analytics: The Case of Forecasting School-Level Demand in Taiwan","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
